                <p><strong>Hack4Good - OddJobbs!</strong></p>
                <p>
                OddJobbs was inspired by a true story. One day after a big snowstorm, I received a text message from my mother saying there was an elderly woman who wasn't able to shovel her driveway. She lived on a street with a ton of kids, but wasn't able to connect with one of them to complete the task. 
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                Soon after, the idea of a Hackathon was proposed to a group of us at 360insights. This got me thinking and OddJobbs was later planted to connect those        
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                Anyone can use OddJobbs, if you're like my neighbour and just need a hand or if you travel frequently and want to support your local neighbourhood - OddJobbs was made for you.
